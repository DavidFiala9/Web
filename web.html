                Originally an apolitical character, I was appropriated from 2015 to 2016 onward as a symbol of the alt-right movement. The Anti-Defamation League included me in its hate symbol database in 2016, but said most instances of me were not used in a hate-related context. Since then, Furie has expressed his dismay at me being used as a hate symbol and has sued organizations for doing so.

            <strong>
                In 2019, I was used by protesters in the 2019â€“2020 Hong Kong protests. Despite being used in a political context, use of me in Hong Kong is not perceived as being connected with alt-right ideology. Furie has welcomed the use of me by Hong Kong protesters.

            <strong>
                I remain a recognizable and familiar sight on social media platforms like 4chan, Twitch, Reddit, and Discord, where images are modified into custom Pepe-based emoji.
